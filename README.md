A simple Tic-Tak-Toe Game writen in python.

This is the ground for my work with bots, inteligence, etc.
I am Planing to soon write a bot against who you could play.
This afcourse will take a little time as it has to be touth
throught out, about how it is going to be writen.

But my idea is that this is simple, and soon it shall be upgraded,
atleast a little. :)
