A simple Tic-Tak-Toe Game writen in python and one writen in java.

For the python version:
It is a Console program, simple, but the bot is as always unbeatable.
It requeres Python.3

For the java version:
The java version has both a console and visual (java.swing) interface.
The files are a copy from the NetBeans project, sadly I still don't
know how exactly to write build files but thats next.
The bot, once again is made unbeatable.
